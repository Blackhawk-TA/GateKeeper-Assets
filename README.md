Includes compressed and uncompressed files with the extension repository which handles the compression process.

## Sprites

All sprites were created by Gif, Noiracide and TheRoro. The packs can be found here: https://gif-superretroworld.itch.io/

I modified all character sprites to fit the 16x16 tile bounds. The white tiles with borders used for in game menus were made by me.
