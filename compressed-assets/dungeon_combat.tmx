<!--The first layer shows the amount of total data entries.-->
<!--The data itself is split into pairs. The first value shows the how often the tile is rendered in a row. The second is the tile id.-->
<!--The highest repetition count is 255 to allow storing it in an unsigned 8bit integer. If a tile is repeated more often, it is split into several pairs.-->
